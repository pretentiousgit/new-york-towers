# Tenementary

Tenements, the iconic housing of New York City from the 1800s to the first world war. The six-story walkup, lining endless city streets that stretch to every horizon.

Every tenement gets an air shaft, or a fire escape, or a piece of ornament. An air conditioner here, a plant there, sometimes fanciful, sometimes plain, always _more_.

A lot of New York apartments are empty now, held as investments rather than places to live. The tenement, a model building unique in execution, is an interesting thing to try to procedually generate - exact, same-ish, yet every one slightly different.

Inspired by Luc Sante's Low Life, this generator builds housing, or tries to represent the idea of it.

### Todo

* windows that cannot open cannot have AC
* Fix fire escapes to have max rise/run, line up railings
* move buildings up to allow for taller ground floor
